This is a basic Express app that fetches a list of posts, joins them with users and renders them as a table.<br>
This project was bootstrapped with [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

## Time spent
~ 40 minutes for posts import script<br>
~ 50 minutes to bootstrap app, join data, render table, add a bit of styling<br>
~ 25 minutes to refactor and clean up code<br>
~ 5 minutes for README.md file

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## DB decision
I used SQLite DB to simplify project deployment / sharing. It eliminates the need to setup DBMS. Although 100 records feels ok to store in SQLite
